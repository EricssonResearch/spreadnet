Plots the prediction with prediction probabilities for a single graph.    
single graphs. This could help us understand how the network behaves. 


TODO:
    1. Connect to the data loader. 
    2. Connect to the same graph generator PyG uses for new graph 
        generation.
    3. Finish defining the tests and their purpose in the
        context.
    4. Connect to utils so that both PyG and tensorflow can be tested.    

Reminder:
    Same test should work for both implementations. 
    Implementation specifc operation should be dealt with
    in the utils not here.
