"""Graph generator to generate graphs randomly.The graphs are geographic
threshold graphs, but with added edges via a minimum spanning tree algorithm,
to ensure all nodes are connected.

This Graph generator is modified from the graph generation part of tensorflow/gnn
    https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/examples/notebooks/graph_network_shortest_path.ipynb

TODO: Code duplicated in the tf_gnn utils also. One copy has to be removed.
      Do all models require this type of data generation?
TODO: For the final spreadnet(aka non epxerimental).
      Get rid of all code that is not written by us so that
      we do not have to bother with their license.
